## Overview

This project contains solutions to various LeetCode problems categorized by data structures and algorithms. Each
solution is implemented in Java with comprehensive documentation and follows best practices for code clarity and
maintainability.

**Project Origin & Purpose:** This repository started as a personal documentation effort to track the LeetCode questions
I studied. It served as my own reference guide for algorithm and data structure concepts. Now, others may fork it for
their own use to expedite learning or recapping algorithms and data structures.
